# getting-and-cleaning-data-week-4-project
Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" week 4 project
CodeBook.md describes the how to use all this, variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file. Here are the five steps:

<br>1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
<br>2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br>
<br>3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.<br>
<br>4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.<br>
<br>5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.<br>

tidyData.txt is the output of the final step
